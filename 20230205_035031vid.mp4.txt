https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Everest#Naming_of_Mount_Everest
Today I learned Mount Everest is named after Sir George Everest despite him having zero connection to the mountain (he never even saw it) and against his own wishes. He objected to the naming on the grounds that "Everest" could not be easily written in Hindi nor pronounced by the local people.
